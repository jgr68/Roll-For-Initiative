Roll this thing out feature by feature.

1. About page

	Just a simple about page.
	Get this thing looking spiffy.
	Make sure enough of the code is reusable
	so that you can recycle it for later features.
2. Events page.
	Self explanatory. By this point you should have something
	that you can demo.
3. Contact Page.
	Also self explanitory.
4. Mailing list.
	Last and most tricky one. Then we should have a full prototype.
